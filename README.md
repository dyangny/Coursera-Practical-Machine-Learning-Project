Practical-Machine-Learning-Project
==================================

The Project_Writeup.html file nicely sums up the project. I apologize that I am unable to create an gh-pages branch. You may have to clone the repo to view the compiled HTML file.

However, I neglected to print out the prediction results on the test data set and will not be able to do so since the publishing process takes 4 hours on my machine.

The prediction results are as follows:  
1. B  
2. A  
3. B  
4. A  
5. A  
6. E  
7. D  
8. B  
9. A  
10. A  
11. B  
12. C  
13. B  
14. A  
15. E  
16. E  
17. A  
18. B  
19. B  
20. B
